                                                Essentially, the best time to sell is when no-one else is selling. The property market, like any other market, is simply supply and demand – Prices trend up when demand is high and supply is low whereas prices also tend to soften when there is little demand and high volumes of property stock available.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
If you are thinking about selling, try and time your campaign so that your house is for sale at a time when there’s not much else out there. This way, you have less competition for the attention of buyers and are more likely to obtain a premium price.

                                                This will depend on the current age and condition of your home. If you live in an old house which has mostly original fixtures, you may need to look at upgrading some aspects of the property in order to get maximum value for it from the market. If the house is in generally good condition, and the fixtures are reasonably modern, they you might get away with just doing some cosmetic refurbishments and general maintenance to spruce the place up.

                                                Estate agents’ fees can vary quite dramatically across different areas and companies. In the past, there were industry standard fee structures in place (“Standard REIQ Commission”, as it used to be referred to was 5% of the 1st $18,000, 2.5% thereafter + GST) but since the dismantling of the Property Agents & Motor Dealer’s Act in 2014, and the subsequent implementation of the Property Occupations Act, agent fees are now completely deregulated – Meaning agents can charge as much or as little as they choose.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Depending on a number of factors, most agents charge anywhere between 2% – 3.5% of the sale price, although there are agents who will charge both lower and higher rates. It is important to remember that the advertising costs or “Marketing Investment” will often be a separate component of the agent fee structure. This is sometimes paid upfront, other times at settlement but normally this will be in addition the the commission.
